"The written and audiovisual media are an essential link in political pluralism.	 Their	
digitization and the explosion of online information content are a priori encouraging the	
formation of plural opinions, which guarantee the proper functioning of democracy.	For	
so much so, this pluralism of contents and sources is not in itself synonymous with quality of	
information.	It is to these issues of pluralism and quality of online information that	
are interested in the researchers of the national PIL project (http://www.anr-pil.org/) started in	
2018.
As an online social network, Youtube provides a public space for sharing	
of information and interaction between users, as well as for the co-creation of	
the development of toxic behaviors, political propaganda or even the development of a	
radicalized content.	 It is in this context that ANR PIL researchers have extracted a	
large database of Youtube videos from 58 French media channels, which constitue the data set challenge_youtube_toxic.csv"
