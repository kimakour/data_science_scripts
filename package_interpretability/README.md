### Anomaly detection using autoencoders 
- Explain the features that led to an anomaly using autoencoders.

### Post prediction analysis 
- Adjusted cosine similarity to compute similarities between samples. The adjusted comes from weighting the features according to their importance ( after scaling them of course!).
